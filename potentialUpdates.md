## 1. Introduction: Solving AI Amnesia

AI assistants struggle with maintaining context across sessions. This leads to
repetitive explanations, inconsistent solutions, and lost continuity. The BIG
BRAIN Memory Bank System solves these challenges by externalizing memory into a
structured, dynamic, and self-updating documentation network. By combining
cognitive memory models with adaptive workflows and rigorous rule-based
processing, our AI agent can "remember" every critical project detail—even
between sessions.

---

## 2. Cognitive Memory Model

Our integrated system mimics human memory by dividing storage into:

- **Working Memory:** The active context window where temporary information is
  processed.
- **Long-Term Memory:** Divided into:
  - **Episodic Memory:** Records of experiences, session summaries, and
    milestones.
  - **Semantic Memory:** Core factual knowledge about the project (e.g., domain
    concepts, technical specifications).
  - **Procedural Memory:** Step-by-step guides, workflows, and operational
    procedures.

This approach ensures that both immediate and historical project knowledge are
accessible when needed.

## 3. Optimized Memory Bank Architecture

The file system is organized into clear, modular layers to optimize retrieval
and maintenance:

## 4. Dual-Axis Adaptive Workflow System

Our workflow process adapts along two axes: task complexity and development
mode.

### 4.1 Complexity Assessment Framework

Every task is evaluated based on:

- **Scope:** Is it a narrow fix or a broad, system-wide change?
- **Risk Level:** How critical is the task?
- **Dependencies:** How many external systems or modules are involved?
- **Technical Difficulty:** Is it a simple bug fix or a complex architectural
  challenge?

Tasks are then assigned a complexity level from **1** (Quick Bug Fix) to **4**
(Complex System), dictating the required documentation and process rigor.
citeturn1file1 citeturn1file2

### 4.2 Workflow Modes: Plan vs. Act

- **Plan Mode:** Emphasizes strategic thinking, thorough exploration, and
  detailed planning. Use this mode when designing new features, evaluating
  alternatives, or planning refactoring.

- **Act Mode:** Focuses on efficient execution using established patterns and
  quick implementation. Ideal for routine tasks, bug fixes, or minor
  enhancements.

This dual-axis system ensures that every task receives a tailored process that
is both flexible and rigorous. citeturn1file1

---

## 5. Enhanced Rule Implementation

Our system employs a robust set of rules to maintain context and guide task
execution.

### 5.1 Three-Tier Rule System

1. **Always-Applied Rules:** Critical rules that run on every interaction, kept
   concise to conserve context.
2. **Auto-Attached Rules:** Context-sensitive rules that load based on specific
   file patterns or conditions (e.g., language- or framework-specific rules).
3. **Agent-Requested Rules:** Detailed reference rules that are loaded on
   demand, ensuring flexibility without overloading the context.

_Enhancement Note:_ This three-tier approach, inspired by multiple advanced
systems, optimizes context usage while ensuring necessary information is always
at hand. citeturn1file1

### 5.2 Task Tracking and Adaptive Complexity

- **Task Tracking:** A dedicated `tasks.md` file serves as the single source of
  truth for task status, detailing each task’s complexity, stage (e.g.,
  Initialization, Planning, Implementation, Verification), and current mode
  (Plan or Act).

- **Adaptive Complexity:** Rules dynamically adjust workflow rigor based on the
  assessed complexity. Higher-level tasks (Levels 3–4) require a comprehensive
  creative phase before proceeding with implementation. citeturn1file0
  citeturn1file2

### 5.3 Creative Phase Framework

For complex tasks, a mandatory creative phase ensures thorough design
evaluation:

1. **Problem Analysis:** Document the current state, limitations, requirements,
   and constraints.
2. **Options Exploration:** Evaluate at least three alternatives using an
   evaluation matrix.
3. **Decision Making:** Record the chosen approach with explicit rationale.
4. **Implementation Planning:** Develop a detailed, step-by-step plan.
5. **Quality Verification:** Confirm that the solution meets predetermined
   quality criteria before exiting the creative phase.

_The structured creative phase—drawn from the best practices in advanced
guides—ensures high-quality design decisions are made prior to implementation._

## 6. Streamlined Command System

An efficient command system is essential for interacting with the Memory Bank.

### 6.1 Initialization and BIG Command

- **Initialization Commands:**

  - `initialize memory bank` – Sets up the core memory structure using
    standardized file templates.

- **BIG Command:** Our signature quick-start command (named BIG, reflecting our
  BIG BRAIN identity) performs:

  - File verification (ensuring core files and directories exist)
  - Task complexity assessment
  - Workflow mode identification

  This command aligns the AI immediately with the current project context and
  workflow.

  _Example:_

  ```
  User: BIG create a new API endpoint for user authentication

  AI: OK BIG

  I'll verify the critical files, assess task complexity, and determine the current workflow mode...
  ```

  citeturn1file2

### 6.2 Mode Switching and Memory Updates

- **Mode Switching Commands:**

  - `switch to plan mode` and `switch to act mode` – Dynamically adjust the AI’s
    operational mode.

- **Memory Update Commands:**
  - `update memory bank` – Instructs the AI to review and refresh key memory
    files (e.g., activeContext, progress, projectRules).

### 6.3 Bedtime Protocol & Session Wrap-Up

Before ending a session, execute the **bedtime protocol**:

- Update all memory files.
- Create a session summary stored in the Long-Term Memory (episodic/sessions).
- Perform versioning and consistency checks to ensure a smooth handover to the
  next session.

_These procedures guarantee that every session concludes with an updated,
preserved state for seamless future interactions._ citeturn1file1

## 7. Practical File Templates and Documentation

Standardized templates ensure consistency across core documents:

### Example: projectbrief.md Template

```
# Project Brief

## Project Overview
[Provide a concise description of the project]

## Core Requirements
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Requirement 3

## Project Goals
- Goal 1
- Goal 2
- Goal 3

## Scope and Constraints
- Scope item 1
- Constraint 1
```

### Example: activeContext.md Template

```
# Active Context

## Current Focus
[Describe current work focus and priorities]

## Workflow Mode
[PLAN or ACT]

## Recent Changes
- Change 1 (Date)
- Change 2 (Date)

## Next Steps
- Next step 1
- Next step 2

## Blockers
- Blocker 1
- Blocker 2
```

_These templates, inspired by industry best practices, standardize your
documentation and streamline context retrieval._ citeturn1file0
