BIG BRAIN Memory Bank was inspired by and builds upon the work of:

## Original Concept

- **Memory Bank Concept** by [ipenywis](https://github.com/ipenywis)
  - Initial discovery through this YouTube video:
    [I Used This TRICK To Solve The AI Amnesia Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uufa6flWid4)

While inspired by these excellent projects, BIG BRAIN Memory Bank has evolved
significantly with:

- Enhanced cognitive memory model (semantic, procedural, episodic)
- Adaptive complexity system based on task requirements
- Comprehensive Bedtime Protocol for session-to-session continuity
- Dual-mode workflow (Plan and Act) for different development activities
- Integration with Cursor rules system for procedural enforcement
- Cross-platform compatibility and improved organization

All contributors are gratefully acknowledged for their foundational work.
