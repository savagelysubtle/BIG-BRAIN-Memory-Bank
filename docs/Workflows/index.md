# Workflows

Workflows provide structured approaches to common operations in the BIG BRAIN
Memory Bank system.

## What are Workflows?

Workflows in the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system are standardized operational
procedures designed to maintain consistency, efficiency, and quality throughout
the development process. Each workflow defines a specific sequence of steps,
expected outputs, and best practices for a particular type of operation.

By following these established workflows, users can:

- Ensure consistent approaches to common tasks
- Maintain high-quality documentation
- Preserve knowledge effectively between sessions
- Reduce cognitive overhead by following proven patterns
- Increase productivity through structured processes

## Core Workflows

The Memory Bank system includes several core workflows:

1. [**Planning Mode**]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/planning-mode/) - Thorough
   analysis and planning before implementation
2. [**Action Mode**]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/action-mode/) - Methodical
   execution of planned changes
3. [**Documentation
   Updates**]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/documentation-updates/) - Maintaining
   comprehensive Memory Bank records
4. [**Memory Reset
   Handling**]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/memory-reset-handling/) - Recovering
   context after memory resets

## Workflow Orchestration

The workflows in the Memory Bank system are designed to work together in a
coordinated manner, flowing from one to another based on the current stage of
work and specific needs.

The typical flow between workflows is:

1. Start a new session with **Memory Reset Handling** to recover context
2. Enter **Planning Mode** to analyze and design solutions for new tasks
3. Transition to **Action Mode** to implement the planned changes
4. Perform **Documentation Updates** to record changes and insights
5. Execute the Bedtime Protocol before ending a session
6. Begin the next session with **Memory Reset Handling** again

This cyclical flow ensures continuous progress while maintaining comprehensive
documentation and knowledge preservation.

## Workflow Selection Guidelines

To determine which workflow to use at any given time:

- Use **Planning Mode** when:

  - Starting work on a new feature or component
  - Facing a complex problem requiring thorough analysis
  - Needing to understand requirements before implementation
  - Creating a comprehensive approach for a significant change

- Use **Action Mode** when:

  - Implementing a solution with a clear plan
  - Making incremental changes to existing functionality
  - Following an established implementation plan
  - Executing well-defined tasks

- Use **Documentation Updates** when:

  - Completing a significant milestone or feature
  - Discovering new system patterns or insights
  - Before ending a work session
  - When instructed with "update memory bank"

- Use **Memory Reset Handling** when:
  - Starting a new work session
  - After an unexpected interruption
  - When context appears to be missing
  - If responses indicate a lack of awareness of previous decisions

## Workflow Customization

While the core workflows provide comprehensive coverage for most scenarios, they
can be adapted to specific project needs:

- Combine elements from different workflows as needed
- Scale the level of detail based on task complexity
- Add project-specific steps to standard workflows
- Create specialized workflows for recurring project-specific tasks

Document any workflow customizations in the Memory Bank to ensure consistency
across sessions.
