# Planning Mode

Planning Mode is a structured approach to thoroughly investigate requirements,
explore existing code, and create detailed implementation plans before taking
action.

{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Purpose of Planning Mode

Planning Mode serves as the critical thinking and analysis phase before any
implementation occurs. It ensures that:

- Requirements are fully understood
- Existing code and documentation are thoroughly reviewed
- Implementation approaches are carefully evaluated
- Potential issues are identified and addressed proactively
- Implementation plans are comprehensive and well-structured

## When to Use Planning Mode

Enter Planning Mode when:

- Starting work on a new task or feature
- Faced with complex requirements
- Dealing with unfamiliar code or systems
- Needing to make significant architectural decisions
- After a memory reset, before resuming work

## Planning Mode Process

### Phase 1: Requirement Analysis

1. **Identify Core Requirements**

   - Carefully read and analyze the task description
   - Extract explicit requirements
   - Identify implicit requirements
   - Note constraints and limitations

2. **Clarify Understanding**

   - Reformulate requirements in your own words
   - Document assumptions
   - Identify ambiguities or missing information
   - Consider requesting clarification if needed

3. **Define Success Criteria**
   - Establish what constitutes a complete solution
   - Identify testable outcomes
   - Document acceptance criteria

### Phase 2: Context Exploration

1. **Review Existing Documentation**

   - Thoroughly read Memory Bank core files
   - Review related documentation
   - Understand the system architecture
   - Check for relevant historical context

2. **Explore Code Base**

   - Survey the overall code organization
   - Identify relevant modules and components
   - Examine code structure and patterns
   - Understand data flow and control flow

3. **Identify Related Components**
   - Map dependencies and interactions
   - Understand integration points
   - Note potential impact areas
   - Identify reusable components

### Phase 3: Solution Design

1. **Brainstorm Approaches**

   - Generate multiple possible solutions
   - Consider different architectural approaches
   - Evaluate trade-offs between approaches
   - Consider both short-term and long-term implications

2. **Evaluate Options**

   - Assess each approach based on:
     - Alignment with requirements
     - Consistency with existing architecture
     - Maintainability and extensibility
     - Performance and resource utilization
     - Implementation complexity

3. **Select Approach**
   - Choose the most appropriate approach
   - Document reasons for selection
   - Note alternatives considered and why they were rejected

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning

1. **Break Down into Tasks**

   - Divide the solution into manageable components
   - Identify logical implementation steps
   - Establish dependencies between tasks
   - Estimate relative complexity for each task

2. **Sequence Tasks**

   - Determine optimal implementation order
   - Identify critical path items
   - Plan for incremental validation
   - Consider risk mitigation strategies

3. **Document the Plan**
   - Create a detailed implementation blueprint
   - Include pseudo-code for complex algorithms
   - Document design decisions and rationales
   - Note potential challenges and their solutions

### Phase 5: Verification Strategy

1. **Define Testing Approach**

   - Identify testing requirements
   - Plan for unit, integration, and system testing
   - Define validation criteria
   - Document test cases and scenarios

2. **Establish Checkpoints**
   - Define intermediate verification points
   - Create progress validation mechanisms
   - Plan for incremental testing
   - Determine when to switch to Action Mode

## Planning Mode Output

A complete Planning Mode session should produce:

1. **Requirement Summary**

   - Clear articulation of what needs to be built
   - Assumptions and constraints
   - Success criteria

2. **Context Analysis**

   - Relevant system components
   - Integration points
   - Dependencies

3. **Solution Design**

   - Selected architectural approach
   - Design decisions and rationales
   - Alternatives considered

4. **Implementation Plan**

   - Task breakdown
   - Implementation sequence
   - Pseudo-code for complex areas
   - Risk mitigation strategies

5. **Verification Approach**
   - Testing strategy
   - Validation criteria
   - Checkpoints

## Planning Mode Best Practices

- **Be Thorough**: Invest time in understanding all aspects
- **Think Systems**: Consider the entire system, not just isolated components
- **Document Reasoning**: Capture the "why" behind decisions
- **Challenge Assumptions**: Question initial reactions and validate assumptions
- **Consider Edge Cases**: Anticipate unusual or extreme scenarios
- **Balance Detail**: Be comprehensive without getting lost in minutiae
- **Plan for Problems**: Anticipate challenges and prepare contingencies
- **Review Your Plan**: Critically evaluate your own planning

## Transitioning to Action Mode

Once the planning is complete and you have a clear implementation strategy,
transition to [Action Mode]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/action-mode/) for
execution.

The transition point should be reached when:

- You have a clear understanding of requirements
- You've explored the existing codebase
- You have a well-defined implementation plan
- You've identified potential issues and have mitigation strategies
- You feel confident in the chosen approach

## Example Planning Mode Output

Here's a simplified example of a Planning Mode output:

# Feature Planning: User Authentication System

## Requirements Summary

- Users must be able to register with email and password
- System must validate email format and password strength
- Users must be able to log in with credentials
- System must handle authentication errors gracefully
- Sessions must expire after 30 minutes of inactivity

## Context Analysis

- Current system has no authentication mechanism
- Will integrate with existing User model
- Front-end has placeholder forms for login/register
- Will need to add session management to all protected routes

## Solution Design

Selected approach: Token-based authentication with JWT

- Pros: Stateless, scalable, industry standard
- Cons: Requires careful token management
- Alternatives considered:
  - Session-based auth (rejected due to scalability concerns)
  - OAuth integration (rejected due to timeline constraints)

## Implementation Plan

1. Create authentication controller with register/login endpoints
2. Implement password hashing and email validation
3. Set up JWT token generation and validation
4. Add middleware for protected routes
5. Implement token refresh mechanism
6. Add session timeout handling
7. Create error handling for authentication failures

## Verification Approach

- Unit tests for validation, hashing, and token functions
- Integration tests for auth flow
- Security testing for token handling
- Performance testing for concurrent authentications
