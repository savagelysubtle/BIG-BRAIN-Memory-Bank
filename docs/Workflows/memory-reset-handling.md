# Memory Reset Handling

Memory Reset Handling provides a structured approach to recovering context and
continuing work efficiently after a memory reset occurs.

{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Purpose of Memory Reset Handling

The Memory Reset Handling workflow ensures continuity and productivity despite
the inherent memory limitations of AI assistance. This workflow:

- Systematically recovers project context after memory resets
- Reestablishes understanding of the current state
- Minimizes disruption to ongoing work
- Maintains consistency in approach and decision-making
- Leverages the Memory Bank as the single source of truth

## When to Use Memory Reset Handling

This workflow should be initiated:

- At the start of each new work session
- After an unexpected service interruption
- When context appears to be missing
- When responses indicate a lack of awareness of previous decisions
- Whenever the AI assistant seems to have forgotten critical context

## Memory Reset Handling Process

### Phase 1: Context Recovery

1. **Memory Bank Initialization**

   - Read all core Memory Bank files in the specified order:
     1. projectbrief.md
     2. productContext.md
     3. activeContext.md
     4. systemPatterns.md
     5. techContext.md
     6. progress.md
   - Note any cross-references to additional context files

2. **Specialized Documentation Review**

   - Review any specialized documentation referenced in core files
   - Check for feature-specific documentation relevant to current tasks
   - Review integration specifications if working on connected systems
   - Check configuration documentation if relevant

3. **Current Work Context**
   - Focus particularly on activeContext.md to understand current priorities
   - Review progress.md to understand what has been completed and what remains
   - Note any known issues or blockers mentioned
   - Identify the current state of the project

### Phase 2: Workspace Orientation

1. **Codebase Exploration**

   - Examine the project structure
   - Review key files mentioned in recent work
   - Understand the current implementation state
   - Verify consistency between documentation and implementation

2. **Environment Setup Verification**

   - Verify the development environment configuration
   - Confirm that necessary tools and dependencies are available
   - Check for any special setup requirements noted in techContext.md
   - Ensure access to required resources

3. **Task Status Assessment**
   - Determine the status of in-progress tasks
   - Identify any tasks awaiting response or decision
   - Note any pending verifications or reviews
   - Understand immediate next steps

### Phase 3: Continuity Establishment

1. **Work Continuation Planning**

   - Formulate a plan to continue from the current state
   - Prioritize tasks based on documented priorities
   - Identify any gaps in understanding that need clarification
   - Determine the most appropriate next steps

2. **Knowledge Gap Identification**

   - Identify any areas where context seems incomplete
   - Note questions that need clarification
   - Recognize limitations in the current context
   - Prepare to request additional information if needed

3. **Consistency Verification**
   - Ensure planned actions align with established patterns
   - Verify consistency with previous decisions
   - Confirm alignment with project goals and constraints
   - Avoid contradicting previously established approaches

### Phase 4: Engagement Resumption

1. **Context Confirmation**

   - Briefly summarize the understanding of current context
   - Verify alignment with user expectations
   - Address any apparent discrepancies
   - Confirm the current task focus

2. **Progress Resumption**

   - Propose concrete next steps to continue progress
   - Frame suggestions within the established context
   - Reference specific Memory Bank content to demonstrate understanding
   - Present a clear path forward

3. **Seamless Transition**
   - Resume work without dwelling on the reset
   - Focus on maintaining productivity
   - Apply recovered context to immediate tasks
   - Proceed with confidence based on documented information

## Memory Reset Handling Output

Successful Memory Reset Handling should produce:

1. **Restored Context**

   - Comprehensive understanding of the project state
   - Clear awareness of current priorities
   - Knowledge of recent decisions and their rationales
   - Understanding of established patterns and approaches

2. **Continuity Plan**

   - Specific next steps to continue progress
   - Identification of any information gaps
   - Alignment with documented priorities
   - Path to resume productive work

3. **Seamless Experience**
   - Minimal disruption to workflow
   - Consistent approach to problem-solving
   - Maintenance of established patterns
   - Continued progress toward project goals

## Best Practices for Memory Reset Handling

- **Prioritize Core Files**: Always read all core Memory Bank files first
- **Be Thorough**: Never skip the review process, even if it seems unnecessary
- **Focus on Active Context**: Pay special attention to activeContext.md and
  progress.md
- **Note Knowledge Gaps**: Identify and address any areas of uncertainty
- **Verify Understanding**: Confirm that your understanding aligns with the
  user's expectations
- **Be Transparent**: If context is unclear, ask for clarification rather than
  guessing
- **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure continuity in approach and decision-making
- **Document Insights**: Update documentation if you discover new context during
  recovery
- **Respect Established Patterns**: Follow the project's established patterns
  and decisions
- **Prepare for Future Resets**: Consider how current work should be documented
  for future resets

## Example Memory Reset Handling

Here's a simplified example of the Memory Reset Handling process:

```markdown
# Memory Reset Handling Session: E-commerce Order Processing Feature

## Context Recovery Summary

From Core Memory Bank files, I understand:

- Project: Building an e-commerce platform with focus on order processing
- Current Priority: Implementing the order fulfillment workflow
- Recent Work: Completed order validation and payment processing
- Next Steps: Implement inventory check and shipping integration
- Known Issues: Performance concerns with large order batches

From specialized documentation:

- Order Processing System design specifies event-based architecture
- Shipping integration requires specific API format
- Inventory checks must be transactional to prevent race conditions

## Workspace Assessment

- Code structure matches documentation
- Order validation and payment modules complete and tested
- Inventory check module scaffolded but incomplete
- Shipping integration not yet started
- Test suite running and passed for completed components

## Continuity Plan

Immediate tasks:

1. Complete inventory check module implementation
2. Implement transactional locking for inventory updates
3. Begin shipping integration implementation
4. Update documentation for completed work

## Understanding Gaps

Need clarification on:

- Preferred approach to handling backorders (not specified in docs)
- Recovery procedure for failed shipping API calls

## Resumption

"Based on my review of the Memory Bank, I understand we're implementing the
order fulfillment workflow. You've completed order validation and payment
processing, and now we need to implement inventory checking with transactional
safety and begin the shipping integration. I'll help continue this work,
focusing first on the inventory check module. Do you want to discuss the
approach to handling backorders before we proceed?"
```

## Transitioning from Memory Reset Handling

After completing Memory Reset Handling, transition to:

1. **[Planning Mode]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/planning-mode/)** if starting
   a new task
2. **[Action Mode]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/action-mode/)** if continuing an
   in-progress task with a clear plan
3. **[Documentation
   Updates]({{ site.baseurl }}/workflows/documentation-updates/)** if
   significant context needs to be added to the Memory Bank

The effective completion of Memory Reset Handling ensures that work can continue
productively despite the inherent limitations of AI memory, maintaining the
effectiveness of the Memory Bank system.
