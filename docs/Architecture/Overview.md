# Architecture Overview

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank 2.0
system architecture. It covers the core system components, their relationships,
data flow, and the underlying design principles. This architecture is
specifically designed to address the unique challenge of maintaining operational
continuity and knowledge persistence across memory resets.

## System Purpose

The BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system solves a fundamental challenge: maintaining
consistent operational capabilities despite complete memory resets between
sessions. It achieves this through:

- Structured documentation of essential knowledge
- Formalized operational protocols
- Systematic verification mechanisms
- Standard workflows that ensure consistency
- Rule-based enforcement of best practices

The architecture establishes patterns that persist knowledge, maintain
operational integrity, and ensure consistent behavior across memory reset
boundaries.
