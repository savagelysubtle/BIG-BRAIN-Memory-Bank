# BIG BRAIN Memory Bank 2.0 Architecture

This section provides detailed information about the architectural design and
components of the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank 2.0 system. Understanding the
architecture is essential for effective usage, customization, and extension of
the system.

## Architecture Documents

- [Architecture Overview](Overview.md) - High-level system architecture
- [Architecture Components](Components.md) - Detailed component information

## Key Architectural Concepts

The BIG BRAIN Memory Bank 2.0 architecture is built around these core concepts:

1. **Layered Structure** - Organized in hierarchical layers with clear
   separation of concerns
2. **Rule-Based System** - Declarative rules define system behavior and
   interactions
3. **Memory Persistence** - Mechanisms for maintaining knowledge across memory
   resets
4. **Protocol Framework** - Standardized protocols for system operations
5. **Verification System** - Comprehensive verification of system integrity

## Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the BIG BRAIN
Memory Bank 2.0 system:

## Architecture Design Principles

The BIG BRAIN Memory Bank 2.0 architecture adheres to these design principles:

- **Modularity** - Components are self-contained with well-defined interfaces
- **Resilience** - System can recover from failures and inconsistencies
- **Adaptability** - Architecture can evolve to accommodate new requirements
- **Transparency** - System operations are observable and verifiable
- **Consistency** - Behavior remains consistent across memory resets
