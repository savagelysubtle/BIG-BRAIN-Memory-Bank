# How do I organize my cursor rules for maximum efficiency

To organize your Cursor rules for maximum efficiency, you need to focus on creating a clear structure, using effective glob patterns, and writing precise descriptions tailored to your workflows. Here's how to achieve this:

---

## **1. Categorize Rules by Scope**

Separate rules into global and project-specific categories for better organization and applicability.

### **Global Rules**

- **Purpose**: Apply universally across all projects.
- **Setup**: Configure these in Cursor Settings under "General > Rules for AI."
- **Examples**:
    - Enforce coding standards (e.g., "Use TypeScript for all new code").
    - Maintain consistent practices (e.g., "Prefer async/await over callbacks").
    - Apply across all file types or no specific globs.


### **Project-Specific Rules**

- **Purpose**: Address unique requirements for individual projects.
- **Setup**: Store these as `.mdc` files in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.
- **Examples**:
    - Tailored rules for frameworks like React or Next.js.
    - Guidelines for specific file types (e.g., `*.tsx` or `*.scss`).

---

## **2. Use a Logical Directory Structure**

Organize your `.cursor/rules/` directory to make it easy to locate and manage rules:

```
.cursor/
└── rules/
    ├── 000-global.mdc
    ├── 100-typescript.mdc
    ├── 200-react.mdc
    └── 300-eslint.mdc
```

- Use prefixes (e.g., `000`, `100`) to order files logically.
- Group related rules together (e.g., TypeScript, React).

---

## **3. Write Effective Glob Patterns**

Glob patterns determine which files the rule applies to. Use them strategically:

- `*.js`: Targets all JavaScript files in the current directory.
- `src/**/*.ts`: Applies to all TypeScript files in the `src/` directory and its subdirectories.
- `!test/*.js`: Excludes JavaScript files in the `test/` directory.


### Example Rule with Globs:

```plaintext
description: Enforce strict typing conventions for TypeScript files.
globs:
  - "*.ts"
  - "src/**/*.tsx"
alwaysApply: false
---
Always use strict types instead of 'any' in TypeScript code.
```

---

## **4. Craft Clear Descriptions**

Descriptions guide the AI on when to activate a rule. Make them specific and actionable:

- Focus on the context of application (e.g., "Apply ESLint formatting rules").
- Avoid vague language; be precise about the rule's purpose.


### Example Description:

```plaintext
description: Apply React best practices for functional components in TSX files.
globs:
  - "*.tsx"
alwaysApply: false
---
Use functional components, proper prop types, and React-specific best practices.
```

---

## **5. Automate Rule Updates**

Leverage Cursor's ability to sync rules automatically based on file patterns and descriptions. This ensures that relevant rules are always applied without manual intervention.

---

## **6. Regularly Review and Refine Rules**

- Periodically audit your rules to ensure they remain relevant and effective.
- Update glob patterns or descriptions as project requirements evolve.

---

## **7. Leverage Examples and Templates**

Use existing templates or examples from Cursor’s documentation or community forums to jumpstart your setup. For instance:

- A rule enforcing Tailwind CSS usage in React projects:

```plaintext
description: Enforce Tailwind CSS usage for styling in React components.
globs:
  - "*.tsx"
alwaysApply: false
---
Follow Tailwind CSS conventions for styling components.
```

---

By categorizing rules, using precise glob patterns, writing clear descriptions, and maintaining an organized structure, you can maximize the efficiency of Cursor's rule system while ensuring consistent AI behavior across projects.
