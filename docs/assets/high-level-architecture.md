# BIG BRAIN Memory Bank - High-Level Architecture Diagram

This file serves as a placeholder for the high-level architecture diagram.

In a production environment, this would be replaced with an actual image file
(PNG, SVG, etc.) that visually represents the system architecture described in
the Architecture Overview document.

The diagram would illustrate:

1. The seven primary architectural layers:

   - Foundation Layer
   - Verification Framework
   - Command Protocol
   - Creative Phase Framework
   - Checkpoint System
   - Task Escalation System
   - Integration Layer

2. Component relationships and interactions between layers

3. Data flow patterns through the system

4. Key interfaces and integration points

When implementing the actual system, replace this placeholder with a properly
designed architecture diagram created using appropriate diagramming tools.

_Note: This placeholder will be replaced with an actual image file. The
reference in the Architecture Overview document points to
`high-level-architecture.png`, which should be created and placed in this
directory._
