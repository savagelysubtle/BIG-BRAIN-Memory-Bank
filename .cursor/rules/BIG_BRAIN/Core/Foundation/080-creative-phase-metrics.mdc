> **TL;DR:** The Creative Phase Metrics system ensures all creative work meets quality standards through structured exploration, validation, and verification processes.

<version>1.0.0</version>

<context>
  This rule establishes the metrics and processes for creative phases in our Memory Bank system. Creative phases represent periods of exploratory design, architectural planning, or solution development that require divergent thinking followed by convergent validation. This framework ensures all creative work is thoroughly explored and rigorously validated.

    Each creative phase follows this structure:

    1. **Problem Analysis**
       - Define current state
       - Identify limitations
       - Clarify requirements
       - Establish constraints

    2. **Solution Exploration**
       - Generate multiple viable approaches (minimum 3)
       - Document pros/cons of each approach
       - Consider extreme alternatives
       - Explore non-obvious solutions

    3. **Solution Evaluation**
       - Create evaluation matrix with weighted criteria
       - Score each solution objectively
       - Calculate weighted scores
       - Identify preferred approach

    4. **Implementation Planning**
       - Detail implementation steps
       - Define interfaces and boundaries
       - Address edge cases
       - Identify verification checks

    5. **Validation**
       - Verify against requirements
       - Check alignment with constraints
       - Confirm backward compatibility
       - Document verification process

  <section-name>EVALUATION MATRIX TEMPLATE</section-name>
  <content>
    Use this template for solution evaluation:

    ```
    ## Solution Evaluation Matrix

    | Criteria | Weight | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |
    |----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
    | [Criteria 1] | [Weight] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] |
    | [Criteria 2] | [Weight] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] |
    | [Criteria 3] | [Weight] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] |
    | [Criteria 4] | [Weight] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] |
    | **TOTAL** | **100%** | **[Total]** | **[Total]** | **[Total]** |

    ### Scoring Legend
    - 1: Poor - Does not meet criteria
    - 2: Fair - Partially meets criteria
    - 3: Good - Adequately meets criteria
    - 4: Excellent - Exceeds criteria

    ### Selected Approach: [Option X]

    Rationale for selection:
    - [Key reason 1]
    - [Key reason 2]
    - [Key reason 3]
    ```

    Weights should total 100%, and all options must be scored on the same scale.
