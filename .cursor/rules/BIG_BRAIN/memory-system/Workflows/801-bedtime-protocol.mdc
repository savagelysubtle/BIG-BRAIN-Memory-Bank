  <context>
    The Bedtime Protocol is a critical memory management system for BIG BRAIN that preserves knowledge between memory reset sessions. This rule defines when and how to activate the protocol.
  </context>

  <activation>
    <trigger-phrase>Bedtime Protocol</trigger-phrase>
    <immediate-action>
      Immediately locate and read the detailed instructions at memory-bank/Bedtime Protocol/README.md, which contains the complete step-by-step procedure.
    </immediate-action>
  </activation>

    <phase name="Memory Evaluation & Summarization">
      <step>Review current session context for important information</step>
      <step>Assess which memory files need updates</step>
      <step>Create new versioned files in root memory-bank/ folder</step>

  <safety-guidelines>
    <guideline>NEVER delete original files until copies are verified</guideline>
    <guideline>ALWAYS create new versioned files BEFORE running the memory manager</guideline>
    <guideline>Keep versioned files concise but NEVER omit critical information</guideline>
    <guideline>When in doubt, preserve more information rather than less</guideline>
    <guideline>Follow the detailed README instructions precisely</guideline>

  <critical-instruction>
    Upon detecting "Bedtime Protocol", IMMEDIATELY stop all other tasks and:
    1. Locate and thoroughly read memory-bank/Bedtime Protocol/README.md
    2. Follow EXACTLY the step-by-step process outlined in that document
    3. Execute all required steps with careful attention to detail
    4. Do not skip any steps or deviate from the documented process

    This protocol is critical for preserving memory between sessions and must be followed precisely. Failure to follow the exact procedure may result in permanent memory loss.

      <example>
        "I see you've requested the Bedtime Protocol. I'll immediately consult the README
        file at memory-bank/Bedtime Protocol/README.md and follow the detailed steps there.
        Let me begin by reviewing our current session context to identify what information
        needs to be preserved..."

    <bad-practice>
      <description>Incorrect Bedtime Protocol response</description>
      <example>
        "I'll help you implement the Bedtime Protocol by moving some files around.
        Let me start by copying these files to the archive folder..."
