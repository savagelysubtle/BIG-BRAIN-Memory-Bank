<context>
  This rule governs how short-term memory files are managed within the BIG BRAIN memory system.
  Short-term memory represents recently used information that is not part of the current active context.

<requirements>
  <requirement>Maintain versions of recently modified active files</requirement>
  <requirement>Implement proper versioning for files moved to short-term memory</requirement>
  <requirement>Periodically review short-term memory for archival to long-term memory</requirement>
</requirements>

## Short-term Memory Management Protocol

1. Short-term Memory Purpose:
   - Store previous versions of active files (1-2 sessions old)
   - Maintain temporary information pending categorization
   - Hold recent session summaries before permanent archival

2. Versioning Protocol:
   - When an active file is significantly modified, move the previous version to short-term memory
   - Use date-based versioning: filename_YYYY-MM-DD.md
   - Maintain a maximum of 3 versions of each file in short-term memory

3. Short-term to Long-term Transition:
   - Review short-term memory files after 3 sessions
   - Consolidate important information to appropriate long-term memory locations
   - Archive complete session summaries to episodic memory
