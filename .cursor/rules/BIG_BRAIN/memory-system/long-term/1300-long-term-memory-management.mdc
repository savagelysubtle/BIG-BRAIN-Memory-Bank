<context>
  This rule governs how long-term memory files are organized and managed within the BIG BRAIN memory system.
  Long-term memory represents archived information categorized by cognitive memory type.

## Long-term Memory Management Protocol

1. Long-term Memory Categories:
   - Episodic Memory (experience-based):
     * sessions/: Session summaries and experiences
     * milestones/: Project milestone records
     * decisions/: Decision records and justifications

   - Semantic Memory (knowledge-based):
     * domain/: Domain concepts and terminology
     * apis/: API documentation and usage patterns
     * features/: Feature specifications and requirements

   - Procedural Memory (action-based):
     * workflows/: Development and operational processes
     * guides/: How-to guides and tutorials
     * checklists/: Operational procedures and checklists

   - Creative Memory (design outputs):
     * architecture/: System architecture designs
     * components/: Component designs and patterns
     * algorithms/: Algorithm designs and implementations
     * data-models/: Data structure designs

2. Long-term Memory Operations:
   - Add information to long-term memory only after verification
   - Categorize information based on content type, not source
   - Maintain consistent file organization within each memory type
   - Create cross-references between related memory items

3. Memory Retrieval Protocol:
   - Access episodic memory for historical context and decisions
   - Use semantic memory for domain knowledge and feature information
   - Reference procedural memory for "how-to" guidance
   - Leverage creative memory for design patterns and solutions
