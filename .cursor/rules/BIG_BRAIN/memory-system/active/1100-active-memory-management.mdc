## Active Memory Management Protocol

1. Active Memory Files:
   - projectbrief.md: Project foundation and requirements
   - productContext.md: Business and user perspective
   - activeContext.md: Current work focus and state
   - systemPatterns.md: Technical architecture patterns
   - techContext.md: Technology stack and environment
   - progress.md: Project status and roadmap
   - tasks.md: Task tracking and assignments
   - projectRules.md: Project-specific patterns and rules

2. Active Memory Operations:
   - Begin each significant task by reviewing all active memory files
   - Update activeContext.md at the start of each new work session
   - Add new technical patterns to systemPatterns.md as they emerge
   - Update progress.md when features are completed or milestones reached
   - Maintain tasks.md as the single source of truth for task tracking

3. Active Memory Maintenance:
   - Keep active memory files concise and focused on current information
   - Remove outdated information by moving it to appropriate long-term storage
   - Maintain consistent formatting within each active file
   - Verify active memory integrity after significant updates
