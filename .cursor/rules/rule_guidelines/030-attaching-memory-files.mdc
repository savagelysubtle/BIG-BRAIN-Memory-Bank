    <instruction>Use glob patterns in the "files" field to specify which files the rule applies to.</instruction>
    <instruction>Within the rule block, reference additional files using the @file directive.</instruction>
    <instruction>This setup automatically attaches the referenced file(s) as context for the prompt.</instruction>
    <instruction>You can also use the "/" command in Chat or Composer to "Reference Open Editors" for including multiple related files at once.</instruction>
