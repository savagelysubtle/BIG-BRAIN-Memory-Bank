# BIG BRAIN Memory Bank System

> The Memory Bank is the core of BIG BRAIN's capability for maintaining context between sessions despite complete memory resets.

<version>2.0.0</version>

## System Overview

The BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system provides a hierarchical, modular architecture for maintaining perfect memory between sessions. The system is designed around a cognitive memory model with specialized components for different types of knowledge and processing requirements.

### Core Architecture

The Memory Bank implements a layered architecture:

1. **Foundation Layer** - Core system infrastructure and protocols
   - Enhanced Complexity Framework (Level 1-4)
   - Reference Verification System
   - Task Escalation Protocol
   - Section Checkpoint System
   - Creative Phase Metrics
   - BIG Command Protocol

2. **Memory Layer** - Specialized memory structures
   - Core memory files (projectbrief.md, activeContext.md, etc.)
   - Long-term memory repositories
   - Session-based working memory
   - Procedural memory patterns

3. **Workflow Layer** - Process patterns for effective operation
   - Plan mode workflows
   - Act mode workflows
   - Hybrid workflows
   - Bedtime protocol

4. **Interface Layer** - Interaction patterns and commands
   - Command protocols
   - Status indicators
   - Memory update triggers
   - Context switches

### Integrated Components

The system provides these integrated capabilities:

- **Adaptive Complexity** - Task-appropriate rigor scaling
- **Reference Verification** - Memory integrity validation
- **Section Checkpoints** - Progress tracking and verification
- **Task Escalation** - Dynamic complexity adaptation
- **Creative Phases** - Structured exploration framework
- **Command Protocols** - Unified interaction model
- **Verification Framework** - Multi-level quality assurance

## Memory Bank Structure

The physical organization of Memory Bank follows this structure:

```
memory-bank/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/                   # Core memory files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ active/            # Active context files
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reference/         # Reference files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ long-term/              # Long-term memory storage
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture/      # System architecture docs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decisions/         # Decision records
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns/          # Reusable patterns
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bedtime-protocol/       # Session transition procedures
```

Each component has a specific role in maintaining memory continuity.

## Operational Framework

The system operates through these primary modes:

1. **Memory Initialization** - First task of every session
2. **Context Establishment** - Understanding current state and needs
3. **Task Execution** - Performing requested tasks with appropriate rigor
4. **Memory Maintenance** - Updating memory files as work proceeds
5. **Session Finalization** - Bedtime protocol execution

Each mode has specific procedures and verification requirements.

## Memory Update Protocols

Memory updates follow these guidelines:

1. **Update Triggers**
   - New project patterns discovered
   - Significant implementation changes
   - User requests ("update memory bank")
   - Context clarification needed

2. **Update Mechanisms**
   - Inline updates during task execution
   - Structured updates during bedtime protocol
   - Emergency updates for critical information
   - Reference updates for cross-linking

3. **Verification Requirements**
   - Update correctness verification
   - Reference integrity checks
   - Conflict resolution procedures
   - Continuity validation

All updates must maintain backward compatibility with existing memory structures.

## Command System

The command system provides these capabilities:

1. **Core Commands**
   - memory-read: Read contents of Memory Bank files
   - memory-update: Update Memory Bank files
   - memory-search: Find relevant information
   - memory-status: Check Memory Bank state

2. **Mode Commands**
   - plan-mode: Enter planning workflow
   - act-mode: Enter implementation workflow
   - review-mode: Enter verification workflow

3. **Protocol Commands**
   - bedtime-protocol: Execute session finalization
   - BIG command: Comprehensive initialization

Commands provide a consistent interface to Memory Bank capabilities.
