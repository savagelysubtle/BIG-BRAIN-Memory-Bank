# Progress

## What Works

- **Core Memory Bank Structure**: The fundamental structure of the Memory Bank
  is established and operational
- **GitHub Pages Documentation**: Basic documentation site structure is set up
  and functioning using GitHub Pages
- **Jekyll Configuration**: The documentation site is configured with proper
  navigation and layout
- **Workflow Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all core workflows
  is now complete:
  - Planning Mode workflow
  - Action Mode workflow
  - Documentation Updates workflow
  - Memory Reset Handling workflow
- **Documentation Update Tools**: Created and improved scripts to facilitate
  documentation updates and GitHub commits
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Visual representation and explanation of workflow
  connections and transitions
- **Repository Structure**: Organized repository with clear separation of
  documentation and operational components
- **Bootstrapper Implementation**: Lightweight entry scripts for easily setting
  up the Memory Bank:
  - Cross-platform support (PowerShell and Bash)
  - Interactive project questionnaire
  - Git integration
  - Comprehensive rule structure
  - Command system foundation with `BIG init`
- **Memory Bank Cleanup Plan**: Comprehensive plan for optimizing the Memory
  Bank and rules:
  - Detailed analysis of current structure and rules
  - Gap identification across multiple dimensions
  - Prioritized implementation strategy
  - Progress tracking with verification checkpoints

## What's Left to Build

- **Memory Bank Structure Standardization**: Consistent naming conventions and
  organization:
  - Standardized directory naming
  - Consistent file metadata
  - Clear purpose for all directories
  - Improved cross-reference system
- **Rule System Optimization**: Enhanced rule implementation and organization:
  - Bedtime Protocol rule implementation
  - Explicit Memory Bank integration
  - Modularization of lengthy rules
  - Consistent rule naming and organization
- **Bedtime Protocol Documentation**: Detailed instructions for properly ending
  work sessions
- **Memory Bank Templates**: Standardized templates for common documentation
  types
- **Automation Scripts**: Additional scripts to automate common documentation
  tasks
- **Tutorial Documentation**: Step-by-step guides for new users
- **Advanced Use Cases**: Documentation for specialized or complex scenarios
- **Visual Aids**: Additional diagrams and visual representations for complex
  concepts
- **Checklists**: Verification checklists for each workflow to ensure
  completeness
- **Example Outputs**: Sample outputs from each workflow for reference
- **Performance Metrics**: Methods to measure effectiveness of the Memory Bank
  system
- **Enhanced Command System**: Full implementation of the command system,
  building on the foundation established in the bootstrapper

## Known Issues

- **Directory Naming Inconsistency**: "Bedtime Protocol" uses mixed case while
  other directories use lowercase
- **Empty/Unused Directories**: `stable/` directory is empty and `core/`
  directory appears unused
- **Metadata Inconsistency**: File headers use varying formats and completeness
- **Documentation Standards Compliance**: Inconsistent implementation of defined
  standards
- **Cross-Referencing**: Some cross-references between documentation pages may
  need validation
- **Consistency Check**: Need comprehensive review of terminology consistency
  across all documentation
- **Workflow Testing**: Formal validation of workflow effectiveness is pending
- **User Experience**: Need feedback on documentation clarity and usability
- **Edge Cases**: Documentation may not cover all possible edge cases or
  exceptions
- **Integration Points**: Clearer documentation needed for how workflows
  integrate with external systems
- **Versioning Strategy**: Need to establish approach for tracking documentation
  versions
- **Rule-Memory Bank Integration**: Limited explicit connection between rules
  and Memory Bank structure
- **Bedtime Protocol Rules**: Missing rule implementation for Bedtime Protocol
  workflow
- **Workflow Complexity Adaptation**: Unclear documentation on how workflows
  adapt to complexity levels
