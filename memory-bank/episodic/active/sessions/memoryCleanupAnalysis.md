<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context Assessment

The BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system is the foundation for maintaining context
between sessions through complete memory resets. This analysis examines the
existing structure and rules to identify:

1. How effectively the current implementation aligns with documented patterns
2. Areas where optimization could improve knowledge preservation
3. Opportunities to enhance Memory Bank and rule integration
4. Gaps or inconsistencies in documentation or implementation

This analysis serves as the foundation for Phase 1 of the Memory Cleanup Plan
documented in `memory-bank/procedural/active/memoryCleanupPlan.md`.

## Structural Analysis

### Memory Bank Directory Structure

The Memory Bank follows a structured organization pattern with these key
components:

```
memory-bank/
├── core/                   # Not currently used - legacy structure?
├── episodic/               # Event-based memory (sessions, decisions, timeline)
│   └── active/
│       ├── sessions/
│       ├── timeline/
│       ├── decisions/
│       └── milestones/
├── procedural/             # Process and operational knowledge
│   └── active/
│       ├── workflows/
│       ├── checklists/
│       ├── guidelines/
│       └── operations/
├── semantic/               # Conceptual and factual knowledge
│   └── active/
│       ├── templates/
│       ├── architecture/
│       ├── knowledge-base/
│       ├── references/
│       └── concepts/
├── stable/                 # Appears to be empty - purpose needs clarification
└── Bedtime Protocol/       # Critical memory preservation procedures
    └── memory-tools/       # Utilities for memory management
```

**Observations:**

- The structure follows a cognitive memory model (episodic, procedural,
  semantic)
- The `core/` directory appears unused but is referenced in documentation
- The `stable/` directory is empty but referenced in structure documentation
- Directory naming is inconsistent (mixed case in "Bedtime Protocol" vs.
  lowercase elsewhere)
- Root-level Memory Bank files appear to use a different organizational approach
  than subdirectories

### Cursor Rules Architecture

The Cursor rules follow this hierarchical structure:

```
.cursor/rules/
├── main.mdc                # Root-level rule definition
├── BIG_BRAIN/             # BIG BRAIN specific rules
│   ├── Core/              # Foundational system rules
│   │   ├── Command/
│   │   ├── Creative/
│   │   ├── Checkpoint/
│   │   ├── Documentation/
│   │   ├── Escalation/
│   │   ├── Foundation/
│   │   ├── Testing/
│   │   └── Verification/
│   ├── Identity/          # Brand and persona rules
│   ├── Protocols/         # Operational protocols
│   ├── Templates/         # Document templates
│   ├── Utilities/         # Helper functions
│   └── Workflows/         # Process workflows
└── Codebase/              # Project-specific rules
```

**Observations:**

- Rules follow a clear hierarchical organization
- File naming convention uses prefixes (e.g., "400-documentation-standards.mdc")
- Some sections (e.g., Documentation) appear more developed than others
- Integration between rules and Memory Bank structure is implicit rather than
  explicit
- Some rule files are quite lengthy and could benefit from modularization

## Documentation Analysis

### Core Memory Files

The system uses these core memory files:

1. **activeContext.md**

   - Current focus is on bootstrapper implementation
   - Branch-specific content protection is a recent change
   - Documentation improvements are a priority
   - Next steps include bootstrapper testing and command system implementation

2. **systemPatterns.md**

   - Documents architectural patterns and design decisions
   - Includes documentation structure, version control, workflow, and knowledge
     preservation patterns
   - Recently added bootstrapper pattern documentation
   - Well-structured with clear sections and examples

3. **techContext.md**

   - Documents the development environment, tools, and constraints
   - Includes repository structure and file information
   - Documents development workflow and branch usage
   - Explains technical decisions with rationales

4. **progress.md**
   - Tracks working features, pending development, and known issues
   - Current features include bootstrapper implementation and workflow
     documentation
   - Pending items include Bedtime Protocol documentation and enhanced command
     system
   - Several documentation consistency issues noted

**Observations:**

- Core files are well-maintained with consistent structure
- Recent focus has been on bootstrapper implementation and documentation
  improvements
- Some cross-references between files could be enhanced
- Certain sections (like Bedtime Protocol documentation) are identified as
  incomplete

### Documentation Standards

The documentation standards defined in rules require:

1. **Consistent Structure**

   - TL;DR Summary
   - Version Information
   - Context Description
   - Requirements List
   - Implementation Details
   - Version History

2. **Formatting Standards**

   - Markdown with ATX-style headers
   - Emoji markers for section types
   - Consistent code examples
   - Structured tables

3. **Complexity Adaptation**
   - Documentation detail scaled to component complexity levels (1-4)
   - Level 4 (Critical) documentation requires the most comprehensive coverage

**Observations:**

- Not all Memory Bank files follow the documented standards completely
- Some files lack version history tables and explicit requirements sections
- Emoji usage is inconsistent across documentation
- The complexity adaptation approach is applied inconsistently

   - Task contextualization
   - Readiness confirmation

2. **Memory Update Workflow**

   - Change assessment
   - Update preparation
   - Content modification
   - Cross-reference updates
   - Verification

3. **Verification Workflow**

   - Scope definition
   - Structure verification
   - Content verification
   - Cross-reference validation
   - Issue reporting

4. **Bedtime Protocol Workflow**
   - Memory consolidation
   - State preservation
   - Continuity preparation
   - Session summary creation
   - Memory consistency verification

**Observations:**

- Workflow documentation exists but implementation evidence varies
- Bedtime Protocol is well-documented but lacks rule implementation
- Cross-references between workflows are limited
- Workflow application with different complexity levels is not clearly
  documented
