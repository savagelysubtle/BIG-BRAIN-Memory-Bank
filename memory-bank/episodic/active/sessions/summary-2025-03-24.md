# Session Summary: 2025-03-24

## Overview

This session focused on implementing Phase 2 of the Memory System Enhancement
Plan, specifically the Enhanced Cognitive Model implementation including Memory
Type Organization, Workflow Implementation, and Rule System Integration.

## Accomplishments

- Created comprehensive Memory Type Organization system with structured
  directories and templates
- Implemented Workflow Implementation system with mode-specific operations and
  complexity-driven behavior
- Developed Rule System Integration with three-tier architecture and conflict
  detection
- Created physical directory structure for all memory types
- Added example files demonstrating memory type templates

## Challenges

- PowerShell command syntax differences requiring adjustment for directory
  creation
- Terminal command execution issues with multi-line commands
- Ensuring comprehensive cross-referencing between memory systems

## Decisions Made

- Implemented full three-tier rule architecture [â†’
  Semantic:architecture/rule-system-architecture.md]
- Created comprehensive directory structure for all memory types
- Established memory strength indicators with recency, frequency, and importance
  factors
- Designed workflow transition system with validation checks

## Next Steps

- Implement additional example files for each memory type
- Create cross-references between memory files to demonstrate linking
- Begin implementing Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Update activeContext.md to reflect Phase 2 completion

## Memory Strength: HIGH
