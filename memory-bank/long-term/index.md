# Long-Term Memory Index

## Overview

This index catalogs stable knowledge that has been moved from active and root directories into appropriate long-term memory categories. The content is organized according to the cognitive memory model: episodic (experiences), semantic (concepts and knowledge), procedural (workflows), and creative (designs and architecture).

## Episodic Memory

Records of experiences, sessions, and event-based knowledge.

### Sessions

- [Analytics Development Session](episodic/sessions/analytics-development-session.md) - Documentation of the session where the Analytics feature was implemented.

## Semantic Memory

Conceptual knowledge, domain information, and factual data.

### Concepts

- [Memory Health Concepts](semantic/concepts/memory-health-concepts.md) - Definitions and explanations of memory health metrics and maintenance strategies.

### Domain

- [Memory Bank Concepts](semantic/domain/memory-bank-concepts.md) - Core concepts of the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system.

### Features

- [Analytics Feature](semantic/features/analytics-feature.md) - Comprehensive documentation of the Memory Analytics feature.

## Procedural Memory

Workflows, processes, and how-to knowledge.

### Workflows

- [Bedtime Protocol](procedural/workflows/bedtime-protocol.md) - The workflow for preserving memory between sessions.
- [Analytics Usage](procedural/workflows/analytics-usage.md) - Step-by-step guide for using Memory Bank Analytics.

## Creative Memory

Designs, architectures, and creative assets.

### Architecture

- [System Architecture](creative/architecture/system-architecture.md) - The architectural design of the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system.

## Organization Guide

## Moved Content Summary

The following stable knowledge has been moved from root and active directories to long-term memory:

1. **System concepts and architecture**:
   - Memory bank cognitive model
   - System architecture and components
   - Memory health concepts

2. **Analytics feature documentation**:
   - Feature specifications
   - Health metrics definitions
   - Command usage patterns

3. **Workflow procedures**:
   - Bedtime Protocol workflow
   - Analytics usage procedures
   - Memory maintenance strategies

4. **Session documentation**:
   - Analytics Development Session

## Memory Health Impact

Moving this stable knowledge to long-term memory has:

1. Improved the long-term memory ratio
2. Enhanced category balance across all four types
3. Organized related concepts into appropriate categories
4. Established a foundation for future memory growth

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. Regularly update this index when adding new content to long-term memory
2. Maintain logical groupings within each category
3. Ensure content in each category follows consistent formatting and organization
4. Run memory analytics after significant changes to verify improved health metrics
