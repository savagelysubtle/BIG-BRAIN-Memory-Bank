# Workflow-Rule Integration Map

> **TL;DR:** This document provides a comprehensive mapping between documented
> workflows and their supporting rules, identifying integration gaps with a
> particular focus on the Bedtime Protocol implementation.

<version>1.0.0</version>

## üìä Integration Overview

This analysis maps each documented workflow to its supporting rules, identifies
workflows without adequate rule implementation, and documents critical gaps that
need to be addressed in future development phases.

### Mapping Methodology

The analysis used the following methodology:

1. Identified all documented workflows in the Memory Bank
2. Cataloged all rule files in the `.cursor/rules` directory
3. Mapped each workflow to supporting rules based on functionality
4. Identified workflows with missing or inadequate rule support
5. Documented specific gaps requiring implementation

## üîÑ Workflow-Rule Mappings

### 1. Memory Cleanup Workflow

**Workflow Source**:
`memory-bank/procedural/active/workflows/memoryCleanupWorkflow.md`
**Complexity**: Level 4

| Workflow Component         | Supporting Rules                                                                | Implementation Status | Notes                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overall Workflow Structure | `.cursor/rules/BIG_BRAIN/Workflows/800-memory-operations-workflow.mdc`          | Partial Support       | The memory operations workflow rule provides general structure but lacks specific Memory Bank cleanup operations |
| Task Complexity Framework  | `.cursor/rules/BIG_BRAIN/Core/Foundation/040-enhanced-complexity-framework.mdc` | Full Support          | The complexity framework fully supports the complexity levels used in the workflow                               |

| Task Escalation Protocol   | `.cursor/rules/BIG_BRAIN/Core/Foundation/060-task-escalation-protocol.mdc`      | Full Support          | Supports the workflow's escalation needs when issues arise                                                       |
| Reference Verification     | `.cursor/rules/BIG_BRAIN/Core/Foundation/050-reference-verification-system.mdc` | Full Support          | Ensures cross-references in documentation remain valid                                                           |

**Gaps**:

- No dedicated rule for the Memory Bank cleanup workflow specifically
- Missing specialized rules for directory restructuring and metadata
  standardization
- Insufficient rule support for cross-reference system implementation

### 2. Development Workflow

**Workflow Source**:
`memory-bank/procedural/active/workflows/development-workflow.md`
**Complexity**: Level 3

| Workflow Component              | Supporting Rules                                                       | Implementation Status | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| BIG Command Protocol            | `.cursor/rules/BIG_BRAIN/Core/Foundation/090-big-command-protocol.mdc` | Full Support          | Supports the BIG commands used throughout the workflow             |

**Gaps**:

- Limited integration with code-specific rules for language-specific
  implementation
- No dedicated development workflow rule that integrates all components

### 3. Bedtime Protocol Workflow

**Workflow Source**: Referenced in multiple files but no dedicated workflow
document **Complexity**: Level 3

| Workflow Component     | Supporting Rules                                                       | Implementation Status | Notes                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Session Termination    | `.cursor/rules/BIG_BRAIN/Workflows/800-memory-operations-workflow.mdc` | Partial Support       | The BEDTIME PROTOCOL WORKFLOW section describes the process but lacks implementation details |
| Memory Preservation    | _No dedicated rule_                                                    | **NO SUPPORT**        | Critical gap: No rule implementation for memory preservation                                 |
| State Preservation     | _No dedicated rule_                                                    | **NO SUPPORT**        | Critical gap: No rule implementation for state preservation                                  |
| Continuity Preparation | _No dedicated rule_                                                    | **NO SUPPORT**        | Critical gap: No rule implementation for continuity preservation                             |

**Critical Gaps**:

- **Missing Dedicated Rule**: No dedicated Bedtime Protocol rule in
  `.cursor/rules/BIG_BRAIN/Protocols/` directory
- **Implementation Gap**: No concrete implementation of the Bedtime Protocol
  procedures in rule format
- **Trigger Mechanism**: No defined trigger for when and how the Bedtime
  Protocol should be activated
- **Verification System**: No verification mechanism to ensure protocol was
  executed correctly

## üîç Critical Integration Gaps

### 1. Bedtime Protocol Rule Implementation

**Gap Severity**: Critical **Impact**: High risk of memory loss between sessions

The absence of a dedicated Bedtime Protocol rule represents the most significant
gap in the current rule system. The workflow is mentioned in multiple locations
and partially described in the memory operations workflow rule, but lacks:

1. A complete rule implementation in `.cursor/rules/BIG_BRAIN/Protocols/`
2. Clear triggering mechanisms for protocol activation
3. Specific procedures for memory preservation
4. Verification systems to confirm successful execution

**Recommendation**: Implement a dedicated Bedtime Protocol rule in Step 14 as
specified in the Memory Bank Cleanup workflow.

### 2. Memory Bank Directory Restructuring Rules

**Gap Severity**: High **Impact**: Potential for inconsistent directory
structure implementation

While the Memory Cleanup workflow includes detailed steps for directory
restructuring (Steps 7-8), there are no corresponding rules to enforce or guide
this restructuring process.

**Recommendation**: Create directory structure enforcement rules once the
restructuring plan is finalized in Step 7.

### 3. Cross-Reference System Rules

**Gap Severity**: Medium **Impact**: Inconsistent cross-referencing between
files

The Memory Cleanup workflow includes cross-reference system design and
implementation (Steps 11-12), but lacks corresponding rules to enforce the
cross-reference format and validation.

**Recommendation**: Develop cross-reference enforcement and validation rules
after the cross-reference system design is finalized in Step 11.

## üîÄ Rule-Memory Bank Integration Mechanisms

The current system implements rule-Memory Bank integration through:

1. **File Headers**: Metadata in file headers referencing supporting rules
2. **@file Directives**: Rules referencing specific files they apply to
3. **Glob Patterns**: Auto-attachment of rules to files based on patterns
4. **Cross-References**: Explicit reference links between rules and Memory Bank
   files

**Implementation Gaps**:

- Inconsistent use of rule references in file metadata
- Limited use of @file directives in rules
- No centralized mapping between rules and Memory Bank components
- Missing dedicated rule for critical Bedtime Protocol workflow

## üìù Next Steps

Based on this analysis, the following next steps are recommended:

1. **Prioritize Bedtime Protocol Rule Implementation** (Step 14):

   - Create dedicated rule file in `.cursor/rules/BIG_BRAIN/Protocols/`
   - Implement comprehensive Bedtime Protocol procedures
   - Develop verification mechanisms for successful execution

2. **Create Memory Bank Cleanup-Specific Rules**:

   - Develop rules supporting directory restructuring
   - Implement metadata standardization enforcement
   - Create cross-reference validation rules

3. **Enhance Rule-Memory Bank Integration**:

   - Update file metadata with consistent rule references
   - Add @file directives to rules for explicit file connections
   - Develop centralized mapping of rule-Memory Bank relationships

4. **Document Rule Implementation Requirements**:
   - Specify rule implementation priorities for Phase 3
   - Create rule templates for standardized implementation
   - Develop testing procedures for rule validation

This workflow-rule integration mapping will guide the implementation of missing
rules and enhancement of existing ones in subsequent phases of the Memory Bank
cleanup.
