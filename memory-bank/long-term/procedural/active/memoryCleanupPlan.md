decisions, and implementation details.

### Phase 1 Notes

- Initial inventory of Memory Bank structure shows good organization with clear
  separation of memory types
- Rule structure in .cursor/rules follows a logical hierarchy but could benefit
  from more consistent naming
- Some potential gaps identified in Bedtime Protocol documentation
- Cross-references between memory files are generally consistent but could be
  enhanced
