  - Secondary Commands: Subcommands with colons (e.g., "update memory bank:
    core-files")
  - Tertiary Commands: Options with flags (e.g., "update memory bank --force")
- **Usage**: When operations need more granular control or specification
- **Benefits**: Allows complex operations while maintaining command clarity

### Command Parameter Formats

  ```
  ‚úì COMMAND COMPLETED

  Section Title:
  - [Detail point 1]
  - [Detail point 2]

  Section Title:
  - [Detail point 1]
  - [Detail point 2]

  ‚Üí Summary or next steps
  ```

    memory-bank/long-term/episodic
  - Semantic Memory: Knowledge-based information in
    memory-bank/long-term/semantic
  - Procedural Memory: Process-based information in
    memory-bank/long-term/procedural
- **Usage**: All memory operations should respect this organization
- **Benefits**: More natural information storage, improved retrieval, better
  memory management
