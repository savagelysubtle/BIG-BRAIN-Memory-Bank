# Project Brief

## üìã Project Overview

The BIG BRAIN Memory Bank is a comprehensive framework designed to solve the AI
assistant amnesia problem by creating a structured external memory system. The
project aims to create a GitHub repository containing the complete
implementation, documentation, and examples of the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system,
making it accessible to the broader developer community while properly
attributing original inspirations.

With recent enhancements, the system now includes a scientifically-grounded
cognitive memory model, comprehensive command system, platform awareness
capabilities, memory diagnostics, and enhanced creative processes - providing a
complete framework for AI memory management across sessions.

## üéØ Core Requirements

- Create a well-organized GitHub repository with the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank
  implementation
- Provide proper attribution to original works by Vanzan and ipenywis
- Include comprehensive documentation on using and implementing the system
- Maintain a clear directory structure that separates public content from
  personal implementations
- Create a system that preserves AI memory across sessions with minimal user
  effort
- Implement a scientifically-grounded cognitive memory model for improved
  information management
- Provide a comprehensive command system for memory operations
- Support cross-platform compatibility through platform awareness
- Include memory diagnostics for system health monitoring
- Enhance creative processes with structured design approaches

## üìä Success Criteria

- Repository follows GitHub best practices with all necessary community files
- Clear documentation that enables new users to quickly implement the system
- Proper attribution to original authors in all relevant files
- Directory structure that facilitates both personal use and public distribution
- Functional memory bank system that reliably preserves context between sessions
- Command system that provides intuitive control of memory operations
- Cognitive memory model that improves information organization and retrieval
- Platform awareness that ensures consistent operation across different
  environments
- Memory diagnostics that detect and address potential issues
- Enhanced creative processes that improve design activities

## üîç Project Scope

### In Scope

- Complete BIG BRAIN Memory Bank core files and templates
- Required GitHub community files (README, LICENSE, etc.)
- Setup scripts for easy installation and initialization
- Documentation for implementation and usage
- Example structures and templates
- Attribution to original inspirations
- Comprehensive command system with hierarchical organization
- Cognitive memory model with working and long-term memory
- Platform awareness capabilities for cross-OS compatibility
- Memory diagnostics tools for system verification
- Enhanced creative phase framework for design activities
- Rule visibility system for debugging and maintenance

### Out of Scope

- Custom AI implementation or modifications
- Integration with other AI systems beyond Cursor
- Complex applications demonstrating system usage
- Automated testing frameworks
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Completed)**: Research and development of initial BIG BRAIN
  implementation
- **Phase 2 (Completed)**: Integration of learnings from various memory bank
  implementations
- **Phase 3 (Completed)**: Implementation of cognitive memory model, command
  system, and platform awareness
- **Phase 4 (In Progress)**: Comprehensive testing and documentation of enhanced
  features
- **Phase 5 (Pending)**: Public release and community engagement

## üë• Stakeholders

- **Repository Owner**: Responsible for maintaining the GitHub repository and
  addressing issues
- **Contributors**: Community members who may contribute improvements and
  extensions
- **Users**: Developers implementing the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank in their own
  projects
- **Original Authors**: Creators of the foundational works that inspired this
  implementation

## üîÑ Change Management

Changes to the core system will be managed through GitHub issues and pull
requests. Major architectural changes will require detailed documentation of
rationale and implementation approach. Minor improvements can be implemented
with simpler documentation requirements.

Community contributions will be reviewed to ensure they maintain the core
principles and documentation standards of the BIG BRAIN approach.
