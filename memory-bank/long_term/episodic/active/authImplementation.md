## üîÑ Evolution of the Authentication System

### Initial Approach (2025-01-20)

We initially considered three authentication approaches:

1. **Session-based authentication**: Traditional but less suitable for our
   API-first approach
2. **Basic authentication**: Too simple for our security requirements
3. **JWT-based authentication**: Selected for its stateless nature and
   suitability for our microservices architecture

Decision rationale:

- Stateless authentication fits our scaling requirements
- Easy to implement across different services
- Good library support in our tech stack
- Allows for fine-grained permission control

Initial implementation challenges:

- Determining the right JWT expiration time
- Securely storing the JWT secret
- Implementing proper error handling for auth failures

### Iteration 1: Basic Auth Flow (2025-02-05)

Implemented basic authentication flow:

- Login endpoint with username/password validation
- JWT token generation with 15-minute expiration
- Refresh token mechanism with 7-day expiration
- Logout functionality that invalidates refresh tokens

Code snippets from the implementation:

```typescript
// Authentication service
async function login(username: string, password: string): Promise<AuthTokens> {
  const user = await userRepository.findByUsername(username);

  if (!user || !(await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash))) {
    throw new UnauthorizedError('Invalid credentials');
  }

  const accessToken = generateJWT(user);
  const refreshToken = generateRefreshToken(user);

  await storeRefreshToken(user.id, refreshToken);

  return { accessToken, refreshToken };
}
```

Lessons learned:

- Needed to implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- JWT payload should be kept minimal to reduce token size
- Refresh token rotation is important for security

### Iteration 2: Role-Based Authorization (2025-02-15)

Extended the authentication system with role-based access control:

- Added roles table in the database
- Modified JWT payload to include user roles
- Implemented middleware for role-based route protection
- Created permission management UI for admins

Implementation challenges:

- Designing a flexible permission model
- Balancing granularity with simplicity
- Updating existing routes with new permission checks

### Major Challenge: Security Vulnerabilities (2025-03-01)

During security review, the following issues were identified:

1. Refresh tokens were not being invalidated properly on password change
2. XSS vulnerability in the error messages
3. Missing rate limiting on authentication endpoints
4. Insufficient token validation

Solutions implemented:

- Added token versioning tied to password changes
- Sanitized all error messages
- Implemented IP-based rate limiting
- Enhanced token validation logic

### Latest Iteration: MFA Implementation (2025-03-10)

Added multi-factor authentication:

- Time-based one-time password (TOTP) implementation
- QR code generation for easy setup
- Backup codes for account recovery
- Modified auth flow to accommodate MFA challenges

## üß† Key Learnings

1. **JWT Configuration**:

   - Keep the JWT expiration short (15 minutes)
   - Use refresh tokens with appropriate rotation
   - Store minimal data in the token payload

2. **Security Best Practices**:

   - Always hash passwords with bcrypt
   - Implement rate limiting on all auth endpoints
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement proper CORS configuration

3. **User Experience**:
   - Balance security with usability
   - Provide clear error messages without revealing sensitive information
   - Implement password strength requirements
   - Make MFA optional but strongly encouraged

## üîÆ Future Improvements

Planned enhancements for the authentication system:

1. Social login integration (Google, GitHub)
2. Biometric authentication support
3. Enhanced analytics for login attempts
4. Risk-based authentication
