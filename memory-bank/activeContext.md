# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on implementing a lightweight bootstrapper for the BIG
BRAIN Memory Bank system, enabling easier adoption by new users. After
completing the branch-specific content protection, we've now added a
bootstrapper that allows users to initialize the Memory Bank structure without
cloning the entire repository.

Additionally, we're continuing to enhance the comprehensive documentation of the
BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system workflows and processes. We've recently completed
the creation of detailed workflow documentation pages to provide structured
guidance for key operational processes.

## Recent Changes

- **Branch-Specific Content Protection**:

  - Created specialized scripts (protect-branch-content.bat and enhanced
    merge-to-main.bat) to maintain branch-specific content
  - Implemented mechanisms to preserve the inspiration folder in main branch
    while excluding it from development
  - Added branch-specific .gitignore entries to maintain separation
  - Created automated merge processes that maintain content differences between
    branches

- **Repository Structure**:

  - Implemented a dual-branch structure with `main` (stable) and
    `memory-bank-dev` (development)
  - Created development documentation (DEVELOPMENT.md, SETUP-DEV-BRANCH.md)
  - Added scripts for branch management and setup
  - Updated Memory Bank with branch structure information

- **Workflow Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for the core
  workflows:

  - Planning Mode - A structured approach for requirements analysis and solution
    design
  - Action Mode - Methodical execution of implementation plans
  - Documentation Updates - Process for maintaining Memory Bank accuracy and
    completeness
  - Memory Reset Handling - Approach for recovering context after memory resets

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Added documentation explaining how the various
  workflows connect and transition between each other, including a visual
  diagram

- **Documentation Management**: Created and improved scripts to streamline the
  process of committing and pushing documentation changes to GitHub, with fully
  automated operations

- **Documentation Structure**: Organized the workflows documentation with
  consistent formatting, clear navigation hierarchy, and cross-references
  between related workflows

- **Bootstrapper Implementation**: Created PowerShell and Bash scripts that
  serve as minimal entry points for setting up the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system:
  - Interactive project questionnaire for personalization
  - Cross-platform support for Windows (PowerShell) and Unix (Bash)
  - Proper integration with Git through .gitignore configuration
  - Comprehensive rule structure for Cursor IDE integration
  - Command system setup with `BIG init` for initial project analysis

## Impact of Changes

The branch-specific content protection provides:

- Ability to maintain different content between branches (inspiration folder in
  main but not in development)
- Automatic preservation of branch-specific content during merges
- Clean separation of concerns between production and development environments
- Simplified workflow for managing branch-specific content

The dual-branch structure provides:

- Clear separation between stable and development versions
- Protection of the main branch for clean installations
- A dedicated environment for ongoing development
- Better version control and release management
- Improved collaboration possibilities

The documentation improvements:

- Provide clear, structured guidance for consistent operation across memory
  resets
- Establish standard processes for planning, implementation, and knowledge
  preservation
- Create a framework for maintaining system knowledge over time
- Enable smoother transitions between different operational modes
- Support more effective collaboration with explicit documentation of processes

- **Improved User Adoption**: The bootstrapper significantly lowers the barrier
  to entry for new users by providing a streamlined installation process
  tailored to their specific project.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: PowerShell and Bash scripts ensure consistent
  setup experience across different operating systems.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive README file in the bootstrapper
  directory provides clear instructions for installation and usage.

## Open Questions

- Are there other folders or files that should have branch-specific treatment?
- Should we document branch-specific content patterns in a dedicated file?
- What is the best approach to handle updates to branch-specific content over
  time?
- How should we handle the transition period when users migrate from the
  single-branch to dual-branch structure?
- What is the best approach to synchronize Memory Bank files between branches
  when needed?
- Should we implement automated testing for the Memory Bank documentation?
- Would additional specialized workflow documentation be beneficial for specific
  recurring tasks?
- **Bootstrapper Extensions**: Should additional features be added to the
  bootstrapper, such as theme customization or integration with other
  development tools?
- **Distribution Strategy**: What's the most effective way to distribute the
  bootstrapper to potential users? Should we consider package managers or a
  dedicated website?

## Next Steps

- Document the branch-specific content protection pattern in systemPatterns.md
- Consider implementing similar protection for other folders if needed
- Add guidance on when and how to use branch-specific content in documentation
- Finalize the development branch setup with proper permissions and protection
- Create clear guidance for users on how to work with the dual-branch structure
- Consider implementing branch protection rules on GitHub
- Create documentation for the Bedtime Protocol with detailed step-by-step
  instructions
- **Bootstrapper Testing**: Conduct comprehensive testing of the bootstrapper
  scripts across different environments to ensure consistent behavior.
- **Enhanced Command System**: Expand the command system implementation,
  particularly focusing on the `BIG init` command for initial project analysis
  and context building.
- **Documentation Updates**: Update system documentation to reflect the new
  bootstrapper-based installation approach.
