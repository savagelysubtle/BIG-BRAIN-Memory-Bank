# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is establishing a robust dual-branch structure for the BIG
BRAIN Memory Bank system. We've recently implemented a development branch
strategy to separate the stable "clean install" version from the development
version with current improvements.

Additionally, we're continuing to enhance the comprehensive documentation of the
BIG BRAIN Memory Bank system workflows and processes. We've recently completed
the creation of detailed workflow documentation pages to provide structured
guidance for key operational processes.

## Recent Changes

- **Repository Structure**:

  - Implemented a dual-branch structure with `main` (stable) and
    `memory-bank-dev` (development)
  - Created development documentation (DEVELOPMENT.md, SETUP-DEV-BRANCH.md)
  - Added scripts for branch management and setup
  - Updated Memory Bank with branch structure information

- **Workflow Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for the core
  workflows:

  - Planning Mode - A structured approach for requirements analysis and solution
    design
  - Action Mode - Methodical execution of implementation plans
  - Documentation Updates - Process for maintaining Memory Bank accuracy and
    completeness
  - Memory Reset Handling - Approach for recovering context after memory resets

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Added documentation explaining how the various
  workflows connect and transition between each other, including a visual
  diagram

- **Documentation Management**: Created and improved an update_docs.bat script
  to streamline the process of committing and pushing documentation changes to
  GitHub, with options to handle documentation-only or all file changes

- **Documentation Structure**: Organized the workflows documentation with
  consistent formatting, clear navigation hierarchy, and cross-references
  between related workflows

## Impact of Changes

The dual-branch structure provides:

- Clear separation between stable and development versions
- Protection of the main branch for clean installations
- A dedicated environment for ongoing development
- Better version control and release management
- Improved collaboration possibilities

The documentation improvements:

- Provide clear, structured guidance for consistent operation across memory
  resets
- Establish standard processes for planning, implementation, and knowledge
  preservation
- Create a framework for maintaining system knowledge over time
- Enable smoother transitions between different operational modes
- Support more effective collaboration with explicit documentation of processes

## Open Questions

- How should we handle the transition period when users migrate from the
  single-branch to dual-branch structure?
- What is the best approach to synchronize Memory Bank files between branches
  when needed?
- Should we implement automated testing for the Memory Bank documentation?
- Would additional specialized workflow documentation be beneficial for specific
  recurring tasks?
- Should workflow templates be created to make following these processes more
  straightforward?
- Are there opportunities to automate parts of the Documentation Updates
  workflow?
- How should workflow adherence be measured or validated?

## Next Steps

- Finalize the development branch setup with proper permissions and protection
- Create clear guidance for users on how to work with the dual-branch structure
- Consider implementing branch protection rules on GitHub
- Create documentation for the Bedtime Protocol with detailed step-by-step
  instructions
- Consider creating visual aids or flowcharts for complex decision paths within
  workflows
- Develop checklists for each workflow to simplify verification of completeness
- Create examples of workflow outputs based on real-world scenarios
- Gather feedback on workflow documentation usability and improve as needed
