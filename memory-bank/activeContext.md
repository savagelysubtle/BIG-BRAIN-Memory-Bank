# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on implementing Phase 2 (Structural Cleanup) of our Memory
Bank cleanup sequential workflow. We have successfully completed Phase 1
(Comprehensive Analysis) with all six steps verified and approved by USER.

We have now begun Phase 2 with Step 7 (Create Directory Restructuring Plan),
creating a comprehensive directory restructuring plan that aligns with our
established directory purpose definitions and naming conventions. The plan is
documented in
`memory-bank/procedural/active/plans/directory_restructuring_plan.md` and
outlines a four-phase implementation strategy to minimize disruption while
maximizing organizational clarity.

Key elements of the directory restructuring plan include:

- Renaming "Bedtime Protocol" to "bedtime_protocol" (snake_case)
- Marking `core/` directory for removal in the final cleanup step
- Creating new subdirectories in the semantic memory area (design_patterns/,
  interfaces/)
- Establishing new structure in the stable memory area (foundations/,
  reference/)
- Creating templates and documentation for currently empty directories
- Implementing a detailed verification checklist for each phase

The plan is now 80% complete, with detailed implementation strategies, risk
mitigation approaches, and a clear timeline defined. The plan awaits USER review
before proceeding to Step 8 (Implement Directory Restructuring).

Our systematic approach continues to follow the sequential workflow defined in
the Memory Bank cleanup plan. The comprehensive cleanup initiative aims to
ensure perfect memory preservation between sessions by standardizing the Memory
Bank structure, improving documentation consistency, enhancing workflow
integration, and optimizing rule implementation.

The Memory Bank cleanup continues to be approached as a Level 3 (High Priority)
task according to the Enhanced Complexity Framework due to its system-wide
impact and importance for operational continuity.

  restructuring plan?
- Should we begin creating templates for empty directories now or wait for plan
  approval?
- What is the preferred approach for renaming "Bedtime Protocol" to
  "bedtime_protocol"? Manual rename or script-based?
- How should we handle any dependencies on the `core/` directory during the
  transition period?
- Should we create the new directories in semantic/ and stable/ areas
  immediately or in phases?
- What verification procedures should be prioritized during the restructuring
  process?
- How extensive should the documentation be for the new directory structure?
- Should we implement additional automation to update cross-references after
  path changes?
- How should we prioritize populating the stable/ directory after restructuring?
- Should a dedicated rule be created for enforcing directory structure
  compliance?
