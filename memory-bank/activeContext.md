# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is comprehensive documentation of the BIG BRAIN Memory Bank
system workflows and processes. We've recently completed the creation of
detailed workflow documentation pages to provide structured guidance for key
operational processes.

## Recent Changes

- **Workflow Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for the core
  workflows:

  - Planning Mode - A structured approach for requirements analysis and solution
    design
  - Action Mode - Methodical execution of implementation plans
  - Documentation Updates - Process for maintaining Memory Bank accuracy and
    completeness
  - Memory Reset Handling - Approach for recovering context after memory resets

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Added documentation explaining how the various
  workflows connect and transition between each other, including a visual
  diagram

- **Documentation Management**: Created and improved an update_docs.bat script
  to streamline the process of committing and pushing documentation changes to
  GitHub, with options to handle documentation-only or all file changes

- **Documentation Structure**: Organized the workflows documentation with
  consistent formatting, clear navigation hierarchy, and cross-references
  between related workflows

## Impact of Changes

These documentation improvements:

- Provide clear, structured guidance for consistent operation across memory
  resets
- Establish standard processes for planning, implementation, and knowledge
  preservation
- Create a framework for maintaining system knowledge over time
- Enable smoother transitions between different operational modes
- Support more effective collaboration with explicit documentation of processes

## Open Questions

- Would additional specialized workflow documentation be beneficial for specific
  recurring tasks?
- Should workflow templates be created to make following these processes more
  straightforward?
- Are there opportunities to automate parts of the Documentation Updates
  workflow?
- How should workflow adherence be measured or validated?

## Next Steps

- Create documentation for the Bedtime Protocol with detailed step-by-step
  instructions
- Consider creating visual aids or flowcharts for complex decision paths within
  workflows
- Develop checklists for each workflow to simplify verification of completeness
- Create examples of workflow outputs based on real-world scenarios
- Gather feedback on workflow documentation usability and improve as needed
